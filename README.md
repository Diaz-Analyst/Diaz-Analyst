***Fun Facts about me:***

- I love to play Yu-Gi-Oh! To me, it's a fun game of wits against another person (or a computer). I get to try new strategies to solve a puzzle. If I win, I have fun. If I lose, I reflect and think about how I could have done better, then I edit my deck and become stronger than I was before.
- I'm the Dungeon Master for a campaign for my friends, so far we are enjoying hanging out and playing D&D.
- Started reading Cottages and Cerberus (another TTRPG, like D&D but simpler).
- I love to read Manga/Light Novels, and watch anime.</p>
